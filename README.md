This notebook is a gentle tutorial to essential concepts in statistics. I try to present the concepts in a fun and interactive way and I encourage you to play with the code to get a better grasp of the concepts.

# 2. Topic 1. Exploratory data analysis with Pandas

1- Demonstration of main Pandas methods
Well... There are dozens of cool tutorials on Pandas and visual data analysis. If you are already familiar with these topics, you can wait for the 3rd article in the series, where we get into machine learning.  

**[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)** is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.

The main data structures in `Pandas` are implemented with **Series** and **DataFrame** classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances.

2- In the field of Machine Learning, *data visualization* is not just making fancy graphics for reports; it is used extensively in day-to-day work for all phases of a project.
- **In this task you should use Pandas to answer a few questions about the [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) dataset. (You don't have to download the data â€“ it's already here). Choose the answers in the [web-form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uY7MpI2trKx6FLWZte0uVh3ULV4Cm_tDud0VDFGCOKg). This is a demo version of an assignment, so by submitting the form, you'll see a link to the solution .ipynb file.**
